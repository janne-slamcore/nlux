## About `nlbridge`

`nlbridge` is a lightweight middleware library that provides a simple and flexible interface to integrate

and the language model API, providing a simple and consistent API to interact with several LLMs.

`nlbridge` is developed by the same team behind `NLUX`, and is designed to work seamlessly with `NLUX`.
